# Sidecar EQ - Product Vision & Requirements

**Last Updated**: October 14, 2025  
**Status**: Active Development - UI Refinement Phase

---

## üéØ Core Mission

**Sidecar EQ is an intelligent music player that learns and remembers the perfect audio settings for every song you play.**

Unlike traditional music players that force you to manually adjust EQ and volume for each track, Sidecar EQ:
1. **Analyzes** each song's acoustic signature on first play
2. **Suggests** optimal EQ and volume settings automatically
3. **Remembers** your customizations forever (per-track persistence)
4. **Adapts** as you refine settings across listening sessions

---

## üéµ Primary Use Case: The Perfect Playback Experience

### First-Time Playback Flow
1. User adds a song to the queue (local file, Plex server, or URL)
2. **Automatic Analysis**: Background sonic analysis determines:
   - Optimal volume level (LUFS-based loudness normalization)
   - Suggested EQ curve (based on frequency content analysis)
   - Bass/treble characteristics, peak frequencies
3. **Smart Application**: Song begins playing with suggested settings
   - EQ sliders automatically position to suggested values
   - Volume spinner sets to calculated optimal level
4. **User Refinement**: As song plays, user can:
   - Adjust any EQ band in real-time
   - Change volume via spinner or keyboard shortcuts
   - Hear changes immediately (real-time audio processing)
5. **Persistence**: Settings saved automatically when:
   - User clicks the circular save button (explicit save)
   - User moves to next track (implicit save if changed)
   - App closes with unsaved changes (save prompt dialog)

### Subsequent Playback
- Song loads with **previously saved settings** (user's or defaults)
- No re-analysis needed unless user requests it
- Instant playback with perfect remembered settings

## üîß Critical Features (Must-Have)

### 1. Per-Track Audio Settings Persistence
**Current Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented (JSON storage)  
**Requirements**:
- Every audio file gets a unique settings profile
- Settings include: 7-band EQ values, volume level, analysis data
- Works for: local files, Plex streams, URLs
- Storage: `~/.sidecar_eq_eqs.json` (human-readable)
- Never loses settings across app restarts

### 2. Real-Time EQ Audio Processing
**Current Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **BROKEN** - Placeholder only, no actual audio filtering  
**Requirements**:
- **7-band parametric EQ**: 60Hz, 150Hz, 400Hz, 1kHz, 2.4kHz, 6kHz, 15kHz
- Real-time DSP filtering (hear changes instantly as sliders move)
- No audio glitches or dropouts during adjustment
- Visual feedback matches audible changes
- **Implementation Options**:
  - PyAudio + numpy/scipy for DSP
  - FFmpeg audio filters (complex but powerful)
  - Qt Audio with custom filters
  - Third-party audio engine (OpenAL, FMOD)

**PRIORITY**: This is the #1 feature to fix - EQ must actually work!

### 3. Automatic Sonic Analysis
**Current Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented (librosa-based)  
**Capabilities**:
- Loudness measurement (LUFS)
- Peak level detection
- Frequency distribution (bass/treble ratio)
- Suggested volume calculation
- Background processing (non-blocking)

**Enhancement Needed**: More accurate EQ suggestions based on:
- Genre detection
- Vocal presence/clarity
- Instrument separation
- Dynamic range characteristics

### 4. Unsaved Changes Protection
**Current Status**: ‚ùì Unknown - needs verification  
**Requirements**:
- Track which songs have modified-but-unsaved settings
- On app close: Show dialog listing unsaved tracks
- Dialog options:
  - "Save All" - persist all changes
  - "Discard All" - revert to last saved
  - "Review" - go through each track individually
  - "Cancel" - return to app without closing
- Visual indicator (asterisk?) on queue items with unsaved changes

## üéº Playlist Features

### Save/Load Playlists
**Current Status**: ‚úÖ Basic implementation exists  
**Current Format**: JSON (`.sidecar` extension)  
**Requirements**: **Human-readable text format**

**Proposed Format** (M3U8 Extended with Sidecar metadata):
```m3u8
#EXTM3U
#SIDECAR-VERSION:1.0

#EXTINF:323,Black Sabbath - Paranoid
#SIDECAR-EQ:[-2, 0, 3, 1, 0, -1, 2]

**Problems**:
- Not obvious if Plex server is detected
- No visual indication of available servers
- Difficult to browse Plex library
- Can't tell if connected or disconnected

### Required Improvements

  - Plex servers
  - DLNA/UPnP media servers
  - AirPlay devices
  - Chromecast Audio
  - Bluetooth speakers
  - Sonos systems
- Unified "Network" panel showing available endpoints
- Stream Sidecar EQ output to network devices
- Apply EQ processing before sending to network player

### Use Cases
- **Whole-home audio**: Play through Sonos with custom EQ
- **Party mode**: Stream to multiple devices simultaneously
- **Remote listening**: Access Plex server from laptop, apply EQ, send to TV
- **Teaching**: Stream teacher's EQ adjustments to student headphones

## üêõ Known Issues (Priority Fixes)

### 1. ‚ö†Ô∏è EQ Doesn't Affect Audio Output
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Impact**: Core feature completely non-functional  
**Cause**: `Player.set_eq_values()` is a placeholder, no actual DSP  
**Fix Required**: Implement real audio filtering (see "Real-Time EQ" section)

### 2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Time Slider Shows 0:00 / Doesn't Seek
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Impact**: Can't see current position or skip ahead in songs  
**Symptoms**:
- Position always shows "00:00 / 00:00"
- Dragging slider doesn't change playback position
**Possible Causes**:
- Player signals not emitting properly
- Signal connections not wired
- Player position updates not triggering UI updates
**Investigation Needed**: Add debug logging to position/duration callbacks

### 3. ‚úÖ Opacity Menu Didn't Work
**Status**: **FIXED** - Now references `_eq_bg_widget` (eq_panel)

### 4. ‚úÖ JSON Serialization Error (numpy types)
**Status**: **FIXED** - Added `convert_to_native()` helper function

### 5. ‚úÖ Deprecated Qt Warnings
**Status**: **FIXED** - Removed AA_EnableHighDpiScaling and AA_UseHighDpiPixmaps

## üé® Design Philosophy

### Visual Language
- **Modern Dark Theme**: Professional, easy on eyes during long sessions
- **70s Receiver Aesthetic**: Blue VU meters evoke classic hi-fi equipment
- **Functional First**: Beauty serves usability, not decoration
- **Consistent Spacing**: Balanced layout, clear visual hierarchy

### Interaction Principles
1. **Immediate Feedback**: Every action has instant visual/audio response
2. **Undo-Friendly**: Easy to experiment without fear of losing good settings
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple by default, powerful when needed
4. **Keyboard-First**: All actions accessible without mouse
5. **Respectful Persistence**: Never lose user's work or preferences

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Missing Plex? App still works with local files
- **Clear Messaging**: No cryptic errors, explain what went wrong and how to fix
- **Recovery Options**: Always offer a path forward
- **Silent Fallbacks**: If analysis fails, use sensible defaults without alarming user
