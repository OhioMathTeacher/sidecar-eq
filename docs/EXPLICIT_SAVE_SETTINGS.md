# Explicit Save Settings & UX Improvements

## Overview
Major changes to settings persistence and user experience based on feedback about "volume creep" and auto-save issues.

---

## 1. Explicit Save Button (No More Auto-Save!)

### What Changed
- **REMOVED**: Auto-save on every EQ/volume change
- **ADDED**: Large "💾 Save Settings" button in EQ panel
- **BENEFIT**: User has full control over when settings are saved

### Why This Matters
**Before (Google-style auto-save):**
- Settings saved on every tiny adjustment
- Volume from one song "leaked" to others
- No clear feedback when settings were saved
- Accidental changes persisted immediately
- Caused "volume creep" across tracks

**After (Explicit save):**
- Adjust EQ/volume freely without worrying
- Click Save when you're happy with the sound
- Clear visual feedback ("✓ Settings saved for this track!")
- Each track's settings are isolated
- No more volume creep!

### How It Works
1. **Load track** → Save button becomes enabled (blue)
2. **Adjust EQ and volume** → Changes apply in real-time
3. **Click "💾 Save Settings"** → Settings saved for THIS track only
4. **Next time you play this track** → Saved settings load automatically
5. **Play different track** → Gets ITS OWN saved settings (or defaults)

### User Flow Example
```
1. Play "Bob Marley - No Woman No Cry"
2. Adjust volume to 60%, boost bass (+6 at 60Hz)
3. Click "Save Settings"
4. Status: "✓ Settings saved for this track!"

5. Play "The Beatles - Hey Jude"  
6. Volume resets to 75% (default), EQ flat (no bass boost)
7. Adjust to your liking
8. Click "Save Settings" (or don't!)

9. Play "Bob Marley" again
10. Volume = 60%, bass boost = +6 (EXACTLY what you saved!)
```

### Save Button States
- **Disabled (gray)**: No track loaded - nothing to save
- **Enabled (blue)**: Track loaded, ready to save
- **After click**: Green status message "✓ Settings saved for this track!"

## 2. Fixed Volume Persistence (No More Creep!)

### The Problem
Volume was being inherited globally across tracks instead of being per-track.

### The Solution
**Completely separated volume loading logic:**
1. **Every track** gets its own volume setting
2. **Load track** → Check for saved volume for THAT track
3. **Found saved** → Use it (could be 20%, could be 90%)
4. **Not found** → Use default 75%
5. **NO inheritance** from previous track!

### Technical Changes
- Volume loaded **before playback starts** (not during)
- Saved volume keyed by track path/identifier
- Each source type (local, URL, Plex, video) handled correctly
- Default 75% only used for brand new tracks

### Example Scenario
```
Track A: Saved volume = 90%  (loud track)
Track B: Saved volume = 40%  (quiet track)
Track C: No saved volume     (new track)

Play A → Volume = 90% ✓
Play B → Volume = 40% ✓  (NOT 90%!)
Play C → Volume = 75% ✓  (default, NOT 40%!)
```

## 3. Waveform Click-to-Play

### What Changed
Clicking the waveform now **starts playback** if music is stopped/paused.

### How It Works
**Before:**
- Click waveform → Seek to position
- If stopped → Nothing happens (just seek)
- User confused: "Why isn't it playing?"

**After:**
- Click waveform → Seek to position
- If stopped/paused → **Start playing from that position!**
- Intuitive: Click = "Play from here"

### Technical Implementation
- New method: `_on_waveform_seek(ms)`
- Checks playback state
- If not playing → Start playback + seek
- If already playing → Just seek (old behavior)

---

## 4. EQ Functionality (Partially Implemented)

### Current State
**QMediaPlayer Limitation**: Qt's QMediaPlayer doesn't support real-time audio EQ filtering.

### What Works Now
- ✅ EQ sliders update in real-time
- ✅ Values saved per-track
- ✅ Visual feedback (LED meters, waveform)
- ✅ Volume compensation (reduces volume if EQ boosted too much)

### What Doesn't Work (Yet)
- ❌ Actual frequency band filtering
- ❌ True audio DSP processing
- ❌ "All sliders at 0 = mute" functionality

### Why?
Qt's QMediaPlayer is designed for simple playback, not audio DSP. To add real EQ, we'd need:
- **PyAudio + numpy** for real-time filtering
- **FFmpeg audio filters** (complex pipeline)
- **Third-party audio engine** (OpenAL, FMOD, etc.)

### Current Workaround
- Volume compensation based on EQ boosts
- Prevents clipping when multiple bands boosted
- Better than nothing, but not true EQ

### Future Enhancement Path
```python
# Option 1: PyAudio + scipy for DSP
from scipy.signal import butter, lfilter

# Option 2: FFmpeg filters
ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -af "equalizer=f=60:t=h:width=100:g=+6" output.mp3

# Option 3: Replace QMediaPlayer with miniaudio or similar
```

## 5. Settings Storage Format

### JSON Structure
```json
{
  "/path/to/track.mp3": {
    "eq_settings": [-3, 0, 6, -2, 0, 3, -6],
    "suggested_volume": 65,
    "analysis_data": {...},
    "play_count": 42,
    "manual_save": true,
    "saved_at": "2025-10-15T14:30:22"
  }
}
```

### Key Fields
- **eq_settings**: 7 values, -12 to +12 dB
- **suggested_volume**: 0-100 percent
- **manual_save**: True if user clicked Save button
- **saved_at**: Timestamp of last save
- **analysis_data**: Background analysis results (preserved)

---

## 6. User Interface Changes

### EQ Panel
**Before:**
```
[EQ sliders]
[Frequency labels]
```

**After:**
```
[EQ sliders]
[Frequency labels]
[💾 Save Settings button]
```

### Save Button Styling
- Large, prominent blue button
- Gradient background
- Hover effects
- Disabled state when no track
- Clear icon (💾 floppy disk)

### Status Messages
- "✓ Settings saved for this track!" (green, 3 seconds)
- "No track loaded - nothing to save" (if clicked when disabled)
- "✓ Loading saved volume: 65%" (on track load)
- "⚠️ No saved volume found, defaulting to 75%" (new track)

---

## 7. Benefits Summary

### For Users
- ✅ **No more volume creep** - each track has its own volume
- ✅ **Experiment freely** - changes don't save until you click
- ✅ **Clear feedback** - know exactly when settings are saved
- ✅ **Waveform click-to-play** - intuitive interaction
- ✅ **Per-track customization** - fine-tune every song

### For Developers
- ✅ **Simpler logic** - no complex auto-save triggers
- ✅ **Better separation** - EQ, volume, analysis all independent
- ✅ **Easier debugging** - explicit save points
- ✅ **Consistent behavior** - same logic for all source types

## 8. Migration Notes

### Existing Users
- Old auto-saved settings are preserved
- New explicit save required going forward
- Can re-save existing tracks with new system
- No data loss

### Settings Location
- Same file: `~/.sidecar_eq/eq_settings.json`
- Backward compatible format
- New `manual_save` flag distinguishes explicit saves

## 9. Testing Checklist

### Volume Persistence
- [ ] Play track A, set volume 90%, save
- [ ] Play track B, set volume 30%, save  
- [ ] Play track A again → Verify volume = 90%
- [ ] Play track B again → Verify volume = 30%
- [ ] Play new track C → Verify volume = 75% (default)

### EQ Persistence
- [ ] Play track, adjust EQ, save
- [ ] Play different track
- [ ] Return to first track → Verify EQ matches saved

### Save Button
- [ ] No track loaded → Button disabled
- [ ] Load track → Button enabled
- [ ] Click save → Status message appears
- [ ] Adjust settings → Status clears
- [ ] Save again → New status message

### Waveform Click
- [ ] Track stopped → Click waveform → Starts playing
- [ ] Track paused → Click waveform → Resumes playing
- [ ] Track playing → Click waveform → Seeks (no restart)

## 10. Known Limitations

### EQ Audio Processing
- **Not yet implemented**: True frequency band filtering
- **Workaround**: Volume compensation based on EQ boosts
- **Future**: Needs audio DSP library integration

### Save Reminder
- **No prompt**: Won't warn if you don't save changes
- **By design**: Gives users freedom to experiment
- **Future**: Optional "unsaved changes" indicator
