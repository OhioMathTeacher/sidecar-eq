# Sidecar EQ - TODO List

**Last Updated**: October 19, 2025  
**Current Sprint**: v1.2.0 - "Make It Actually Work"

---

## üö® CRITICAL (Must Fix for v1.2)

### 1. Real EQ Audio Processing - HIGHEST PRIORITY üéõÔ∏è
**Status**: Not Started  
**Estimate**: 2-3 weeks  
**Blocker**: This is THE feature - app is incomplete without it

**Current State**:
- ‚úÖ UI sliders work perfectly
- ‚úÖ Settings save/load correctly
- ‚ùå Audio is NOT filtered (sliders do nothing to sound)

**Implementation Options**:

#### Option A: PyAudio + scipy (RECOMMENDED)
**Pros**:
- Pure Python, easiest to debug
- Full control over audio pipeline
- scipy has excellent filter design tools
- Can add more effects later (compression, limiter)

**Cons**:
- Need to learn PyAudio API
- Manual buffer management
- ~500-800 lines of code

**Research Needed**:
- [ ] Test PyAudio with Qt event loop (threading issues?)
- [ ] Design parametric EQ filter bank (7 bands)
- [ ] Benchmark latency (target: <10ms)
- [ ] Test on macOS/Windows/Linux

#### Option B: FFmpeg Audio Filters
**Pros**:
- FFmpeg already used for video extraction
- Professional-grade DSP
- Powerful filter language

**Cons**:
- Complex filter syntax
- Harder to debug
- Need to rebuild audio pipeline

#### Option C: Qt Multimedia with Custom Filters
**Pros**:
- Integrated with existing QMediaPlayer
- Native Qt solution

**Cons**:
- Limited documentation
- Less flexible than PyAudio
- May not support all platforms equally

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Research: Which option best fits our architecture?
- [ ] Prototype: Simple 1-band EQ to prove concept
- [ ] Implement: Full 7-band parametric EQ
- [ ] Test: A/B comparison with known reference tracks
- [ ] Polish: Zero-latency, smooth parameter changes
- [ ] Document: How the audio pipeline works

### 2. Fix Time Slider üïê
**Status**: Needs Investigation  
**Estimate**: 4-6 hours  
**Issue**: Position shows "00:00 / 00:00", seeking may not work

**Investigation Steps**:
- [ ] Test with actual playback - does it update at all?
- [ ] Check `Player.positionChanged` signal - is it emitting?
- [ ] Verify signal connections in `app.py`
- [ ] Test seeking (drag slider) - does position change?
- [ ] Check if issue is display-only or actual position tracking

**If Broken**:
- [ ] Debug player position/duration callbacks
- [ ] Add logging to trace signal flow
- [ ] Fix signal/slot connections
- [ ] Update UI on position changes
- [ ] Test with various file formats

**If Working**:
- [ ] Update TODO - mark as non-issue
- [ ] Document that it works correctly

---

### 3. Rack Mode Architecture üéõÔ∏è
**Status**: Foundation Started (feat/rack-mode branch)  
**Estimate**: 2-4 weeks (incremental rollout)  
**Goal**: Permanent solution to windowing issues

**Current Progress**:
- ‚úÖ `rack.py` scaffolding created
- ‚úÖ `settings_panel.py` component built
- ‚úÖ Panel stretch fixes applied
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs design decisions on panel structure

**Phased Approach** (Don't break working UI):

#### Phase 1: Define Rack Panel Interface (2-3 days)
- [ ] Design RackPanel base class API
- [ ] Define fixed-size constraints (height only? or width too?)
- [ ] Plan panel registry (how to swap modules)
- [ ] Sketch output window design

#### Phase 2: Migrate One Panel (1 week)
- [ ] Convert Queue Panel to RackPanel
- [ ] Test thoroughly - does it work like before?
- [ ] Verify no regressions in functionality
- [ ] Document migration pattern

#### Phase 3: Migrate Remaining Panels (1 week)
- [ ] Convert EQ Panel to RackPanel
- [ ] Convert Search Panel to RackPanel
- [ ] Convert Settings Panel to RackPanel
- [ ] Test all view presets still work

#### Phase 4: Polish & Optimize (3-5 days)
- [ ] Output window for panel content (if needed)
- [ ] Hot-swap panel mechanism
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts to swap panels
- [ ] Visual feedback for active panel
- [ ] Performance testing

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ No more window resize bugs
- ‚úÖ Panels are truly modular (can add new ones easily)
- ‚úÖ All existing features still work
- ‚úÖ UI feels more polished, less janky

## üéØ HIGH PRIORITY (Should Fix for v1.2)

### 4. Queue Improvements
**Status**: Planned  
**May Defer to**: v1.3 if EQ takes longer

- [ ] **Drag & Drop Reordering**
  - Implement QAbstractItemModel drag/drop
  - Visual insertion indicator
  - Keyboard alternative (Alt+Up/Down?)
  - Works with multi-selection

- [ ] **Multi-Select Operations**
  - Command/Ctrl+Click to toggle selection
  - Shift+Click for range selection
  - Visual highlight for selected rows
  - Batch delete (Delete key on multiple)

- [ ] **Direct File Drag-In**
  - Accept drops from Finder/Explorer
  - Support: files, folders, playlists
  - Insert at drop position (not just end)
  - Auto-analyze new additions

---

## üí° MEDIUM PRIORITY (Nice to Have for v1.2)

### 5. UI Polish
- [ ] Verify unsaved changes dialog works
- [ ] Add visual indicator (asterisk?) for modified tracks
- [ ] Test opacity menu with all panels
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts documentation
- [ ] Tool tips on all controls

### 6. Error Handling
- [ ] Graceful handling of missing files
- [ ] Clear error messages (no cryptic Python tracebacks)
- [ ] Recovery options when things fail
- [ ] Log errors to file for debugging

### 7. Performance
- [ ] Profile startup time (currently acceptable?)
- [ ] Test with large queues (1000+ tracks)
- [ ] Optimize background analysis threading
- [ ] Memory leak testing (long sessions)
